The development for atftp is done using CVS. It is possible to access the
repository read-only by using the following CVSROOT with a null password:

 :pserver:anonymous@heimlich.syspark.com:/var/cvs/atftp

It is also possible to grant write access to the CVS repository for people
wishing to participate in the development. Please address such requests to
either of us.

Thanks

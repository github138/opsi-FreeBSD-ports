The simplest way to install atftp is using either the Debian package
or one provided by your distribution if any. If you need to install
atftp from source, here's the procedure.


1) Needed libraries
   ----------------

  libpthread     Needed for the atftpd server.
  libwrap        Optional if you need host access control.
  libpcre        Optional if you want to perform file name
                 substitution. See README.PCRE.
  libreadline    Optional. Used by the atftp client for better command
                 line input and history.


2) Needed tools
   ------------

  At least, you need these programs:
    make
    gcc
  You may also need these:
    cvs
    automake	(tested using version 1.7 and 1.8)
    autoconf 	(tested with version 2.50)


3) How to compile
   --------------

 3.1) From tarball

  ./configure [options]         (this generates makefiles)
  make                          (actually build the programs)
  su -c 'make install'          (install files (default location is /usr)

 3.2) From cvs checkout

  ./autogen.sh                  (this generate the configure script)
  ./configure [options]         (this generate makefiles)
  make                          (actually build the programs)
  su -c 'make install'          (install files (default location is /usr)


4) How to start atftpd server
   --------------------------

4.1) Using the inetd super server

  Add this line to the /etc/inetd.conf file:

    tftp dgram udp wait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /tftpboot

  You can add needed option to atftpd as you which at the end of the
  line.

4.2) Using xinetd

  Add this to the /etc/xinetd.conf file, or create /etc/xinetd.d/tftp-udp file
  with the following content:

  # tftp-udp
  service tftp
  {
        id = tftp-udp
        disable = no
        socket_type = dgram
        protocol = udp
        wait = no
        user = nobody
        nice = 5
        server = /usr/local/sbin/atftpd
        server_args = /tftpboot  # add other server argument as necessary
  }
  # eof

4.3) As a stand alone server from init.d scripts

  You need to add the proper init script in you boot sequence. The
  Debian package automatically does that. I'm not aware if any rpm based
  distribution include init scripts. If you absolutely need this on rpm
  based distribution or on other systems, start with the Debian
  scripts and adapt it to your particular system.

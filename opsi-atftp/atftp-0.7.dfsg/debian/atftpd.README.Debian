atftpd for Debian
-----------------

atftpd uses /tftpboot by default as base directory. You can change
that by editing /etc/inetd.conf. Remember that you must give the
directory appropriate permissions in order to be able to read/write
files according to your needs.

The /tftpboot directory is not created by the package. You need to
create it and give appropriate permissions by hand.
